- **Language:** Python
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation

## 💡 My Demo Structure

Each lesson folder contains:
```
lesson-folder/
├── README.md              # What I learned + key concepts
├── original_demo.py       # Code from the course
├── my_variation.py        # My own experiments
├── notes.md              # Personal insights & challenges
├── examples/             # Input/output samples
└── requirements.txt      # Dependencies
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Check out my latest work:**
```bash
cd 04-ai-agents-langgraph/lesson-5-persistence-streaming/
```

2. **Run my demos:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python my_variation.py
```

## 📈 Learning Stats

**📖 Course Progress:** 44% (4/8 lessons complete)
